The 2000 Brazilian Demographic Census revealed more than eleven million inhabitants living without electricity. The program Luz Para Todos was created to provide universal access to electrical power throughout Brazil, especially to rural populations needing this public service. This study aims to evaluate the success of this public policy, to see if its original target was achieved, as well as the distribution of funding. Results reveal that more than three and a half million households were connected to power grids and indicate that resources were predominantly allocated to the North and Northeast, regions with the highest underserved populations.
